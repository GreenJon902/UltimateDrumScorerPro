_Hey, this app is in the very early stages of development! It is a program to write drum notes in a way I find easier to read._  

The art style is made to look a lot more simplistic and less cluttered than your standard score with staff lines and all that. It also uses many more symbols for different notes, e.g. toms and snares look different.  
Everything is drawn as lines, as if it were a pencil.
